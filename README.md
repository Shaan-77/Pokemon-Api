## ⚡ Pokémon API Client with Fetch

Welcome to the Pokémon API Explorer! This project lets you fetch and view detailed info about your favorite Pokémon using the PokéAPI. Whether you're a fan or a developer, this tool helps you discover Pokémon data like types, stats, abilities, and more — all from a clean UI.

This project was developed during my learning phase to enhance my understanding of frontend development and working with APIs. It integrates with the PokéAPI to fetch and display detailed information about various Pokémon, including their names, types, abilities, and stats.

The primary objective of this project was to gain hands-on experience with making asynchronous API requests, managing dynamic data, and building responsive user interfaces using modern web development technologies.
